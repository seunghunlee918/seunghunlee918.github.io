## Welcome!
<span style="font-size:14pt;">

   My main fields of interest are Development Economics, Public Economics, and Labor Economics. I am also interested in Political Economy. </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt;">
   Specifically, I study how human capital accumulation and other demographic indicators are affected by various exogenous shocks and formation of state capacity. </span>
