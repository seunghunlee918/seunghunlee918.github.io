<div id="abs_mexmayors" style="display: none;">
    <p style="font-size:11pt;"> This paper examines how the assassination of mayors affects local government capacity, leveraging the quasi-random variation in the success of assassination attempts against Mexican mayors. Compared to municipalities with failed attempts, tax collection falls by 28% and public expenditures shift from essential services to construction investments in municipalities with successful assassinations. There is suggestive evidence that disruptions to local government personnel contribute to these outcomes. Productive municipal workers leave, and retaining them would require an 11% wage increase. More personnel are reassigned from public service delivery to security duties. Non-political violence, economic activities, demographics, electoral environment, and the temporary rise in organized crime do not fully explain these outcomes. The results highlight how the loss of decision-makers in violent environments undermines local state capacity.

<div id="abs_mexmayors" style="display: none;"> 
    <p style="font-size:11pt;">  Conflicts in fragile states disrupt governance, resource mobilization, and service delivery, yet their micro-level impact on local state capacity is under-explored. This paper examines how violent conflicts affect the capacity of local governments to raise revenue and allocate resources for public services, using Burkina Faso as a case study due to its recent political instability and escalating conflicts. We construct a commune-by-year dataset covering all 351 communes over 15 years, combining data on public finance, conflict, and economic activities. A key innovation is the inclusion of planned revenues and expenditures, allowing us to assess how conflicts alter local fiscal expectations and performance. Using event studies and recentered instruments, we find that conflict-affected communes miss revenue and expenditure targets by 6 and 5 percentage points, respectively. This is driven by drops in locally generated revenues and reduced spending on operations and staff. Investment targets also fall short as expected central government grants fail to arrive, deepening fiscal deficits. The weakened local fiscal capacity lasts long after conflicts subside, highlighting challenges in post-conflict recovery

<div id="abs_mexmayors" style="display: none;"> 
    <p style="font-size:11pt;">  This report presents experimental evidence on the short-run impacts of providing monthly income support to low-income households, focusing on their financial stability, employment, subjective well-being, and health outcomes. We examine a randomized experiment in South Korea, the Seoul Stepping Stone Income Project, where 1,584 out of 5,111 households received monthly payments based on their income and household size across two phases. Our findings, drawn from both administrative and survey data, consistently show that households receiving income support experienced increases in total income and expenditures. However, compared to the control group, recipients of income support display lower employment and labor income growth. Notably, income support led to improvements in mental health among low-income households.

<span style="font-size:12pt;"> **Childbirth Effects of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami**</span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;"> (with Elizabeth Kayoon Hur) </span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;">   <a href="#/" onclick="visib('abs_indonesia')">Abstract</a> |  [Paper (Updated: 2022/08/22)](https://seunghunlee918.github.io/research/Dem_Tsunami_Indonesia_final.pdf)  | [Online appendix](https://seunghunlee918.github.io/research/appendix_shorter.pdf) | (Replication package in progress)</span>

<div id="abs_indonesia" style="display: none;">
    <p style="font-size:11pt;"> This paper evaluates the effect of the in utero exposure to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on short-term childbirth outcomes in Indonesia. Exploiting variation in damage intensities across locations and the timing of exposure, we find that the probability of successful pregnancies drops by 5.9 pp, while miscarriages increase by 5.5 pp. However, this does not vary by intensity of exposure across locations. Our results suggest the importance of considering fetal loss in developing countries and highlight that facilitating household investment in health through various policies may mitigate negative birth effects in the aftermath of natural disasters.</p>

<span style="font-size:12pt;"> **Remittance and the Tax Structures in Developing Countries**</span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;">  <a href="#/" onclick="visib('abs_remittance')">Abstract</a> | [Paper (Updated: 2024/03/15)](https://seunghunlee918.github.io/research/Remittances.pdf) </span>

<div id="abs_remittance" style="display: none;">
    <p style="font-size:11pt;"> This paper investigates the relationship between a country's reliance on remittances from abroad and its ability to collect taxes from various domestic sources. Despite the increasing flow of remittances in volume and proportion, particularly among developing countries, their role in determining the state's capacity to collect taxes has received little attention. This chapter explores the link between remittances and various tax revenue categories using country-level data. Two-way panel regressions suggest that a 1 percentage point (pp) increase in the inflow of remittances explains a 0.12 pp rise in consumption tax revenues. The same estimate derived from IV methods proxying for migrant network strength and openness of borders increases to 0.9 pp. Decomposing this result reveals that the increase in household consumption expenditure explains all of the statistical association, not the efficient tax-collecting mechanisms such as VAT. Subsample regressions by income category suggest that the association between remittances and consumption tax revenue is stronger in countries with lower income. </p>
