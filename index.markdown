## Welcome!

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Columbia University

My primary fields of interest are Development, Public, and Labor Economics. I am also interested in Political Economy. 

Broadly speaking, I am interested in how human capital accumulation and other demographic indicators are affected by various exogenous shocks and formation of state capacity.
