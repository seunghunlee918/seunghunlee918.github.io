<span style="font-size:14pt;">
I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Columbia University</span>

<span style="font-size:14pt;">
My primary fields of interest are Development, Public, and Labor Economics. I am also interested in Political Economy. </span>

<span style="font-size:14pt;">
Broadly speaking, I am interested in how human capital accumulation and other demographic indicators are affected by various exogenous shocks and formation of state capacity. </span>
