<p><span style="font-size:13pt;">
  I am an Assistant Professor at Taipei School of Economics at National Tsing Hua University. I am also a Bong and Sul Visiting Research Fellow at the Yonsei Institute of Population and Human Capital.  </span></p>
 
<p><span style="font-size:13pt;">
My research lies at the intersection of <b>development economics</b>, <b>political economy</b>, and <b>public economics</b>, with additional interest in <i>labor economics</i>. My current research revolves around three themes: the formation of state capacity and operation of public finance in developing countries, human capital accumulation under adverse shocks, and the economic and political integration of migrants. I have several ongoing projects that examine how conflicts affect fiscal and personnel capacity, how external shocks such as natural disasters influence education and health outcomes, and how policy instruments can improve access to public goods for migrants.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:13pt;">
Prior to my current position, I was a postdoctoral fellow at HKUST (July 2024 - June 2025). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Columbia University in May 2024.
