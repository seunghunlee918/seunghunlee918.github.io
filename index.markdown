<p><span style="font-size:13pt;">
I have recently graduated with a Ph.D. in Economics from Columbia University. From August 2024 to July 2025, I will be a HKUST-SNU Postdoctoral Fellow. Starting August 2025, I will be an Assistant Professor at Taipei School of Economics at National Tsing Hua University.  </span></p>
 
<p><span style="font-size:13pt;">
My primary fields of interest are <b>development economics</b>, <b>political economy</b>, and <b>public economics</b>. I am also interested in <i>labor economics</i>. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:13pt;">
My research topics revolve around the formation of state capacity and the accumulation of human capital under adverse shocks. In my job market paper, I investigate how political violence targeting local politicians affects the fiscal and personnel capacity of local governments. I also have ongoing projects that study how educational attainment is impacted by religious violence in Nigeria and how birth outcomes are influenced by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in Indonesia.
