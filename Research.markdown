<span style="font-size:12pt;"> **Organized Crime, Presence of Local Politicians, and the Dynamics of State Capacity**</span><br>

<div id="abs_mexmayors" style="display: none;">
    <p style="font-size:11pt;">  This paper investigates the effects of losing local leaders to assassinations on the capacity of local governments in municipalities with organized criminal group activities. Exploiting the randomness in the outcomes of assassination attempts against mayors in Mexico in 2002-21, I find that the fiscal and personnel capacities of the municipality governments that have lost their mayors deteriorate. They are unable to retain their sources of income, evidenced by a 29% decrease in tax collection. Local expenditures are diverted to sectors potentially serving criminal interests such as construction, with its share in the budget increasing by 6.3 percentage points. Furthermore, there are losses of key personnel in local governments, with hypothetical cost of retaining them estimated as 13% increase in wages. These effects are not driven by non-political violence, extent of economic activities, and changes in population. These results speak to the importance of a sustained presence of leadership in determining the performance of the local public institutions and economic development.   </p>

<span style="font-size:11pt;"> (with Elizabeth Kayoon Hur) </span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;">   <a href="#/" onclick="visib('abs_indonesia')">Abstract</a> |  [Paper](https://seunghunlee918.github.io/research/Dem_Tsunami_Indonesia_final.pdf)  | [Online appendix](https://seunghunlee918.github.io/research/appendix_shorter.pdf) | (Replication package in progress)</span>

<div id="abs_indonesia" style="display: none;">
    <p style="font-size:11pt;"> This paper evaluates the effect of the in utero exposure to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on short-term childbirth outcomes in Indonesia. Exploiting variation in damage intensities across locations and the timing of exposure, we find that the probability of successful pregnancies drops by 5.9 pp, while miscarriages increase by 5.5 pp. However, this does not vary by intensity of exposure across locations. Our results suggest the importance of considering fetal loss in developing countries and highlight that facilitating household investment in health through various policies may mitigate negative birth effects in the aftermath of natural disasters.</p>

<span style="font-size:12pt;"> **Remittance and the Tax Structures in Developing Countries**</span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;">  <a href="#/" onclick="visib('abs_remittance')">Abstract</a> | *Draft available upon request* </span>

<div id="abs_remittance" style="display: none;">
    <p style="font-size:11pt;"> Despite the increasing flow of remittances in volume and proportion, particularly among the developing countries, their role in determining the stateâ€™s capacity to collect taxes has received little attention. This paper explores the link between remittances and various tax revenue categories using country-level data. Two-way panel regressions suggest that a 1 pp increase in inflow of remittances explains a 0.12 pp rise in consumption tax revenues. The same estimate derived from IV methods proxying for migrant network strength and openness of borders increases to 0.9 pp. Decomposing this result reveals that increase in household consumption expenditure explains all of the statistical association, not the efficient tax-collecting mechanism such as VAT. Subsample regressions by income category suggests that the association between remittances and consumption tax revenue is stronger in countries with lower income.</p>
