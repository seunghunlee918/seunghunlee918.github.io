<p><span style="font-size:14pt;">
I am a 6th year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Columbia University. **I am on the job market during the 2023-2024 academic year.** </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14pt;">
My primary fields of interest are <b>development economics</b>, <b>political economy</b>
, and <b>public economics</b>. I am also interested in *labor economics*. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14pt;">
My research topics revolve around the formation of state capacity and the accumulation of human capital under adverse shocks. In my job market paper, I investigate how political violence targeting local politicians affect the fiscal and personnel capacity of local governments. I also have ongoing projects that study how educational attainment is impacted by religious violence in Nigeria and how birth outcomes are influenced by the 2004 Indian Ocnean Tsunami in Indonesia.
