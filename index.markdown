<p><span style="font-size:14pt;">
I am a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Columbia University</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14pt;">
My primary fields of interest are development economics, political economy, and public economics. I am also interested in labor economics. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14pt;">
Broadly speaking, my research topics revolve around the formation of state capacity and the accumulation of human capital. One of my ongoing projects focuses on how political violence affects the capacity of the local governments to finance and execute their operations. I also have other ongoing projects that study how adverse shocks such as violence and natural disasters affect human capital accumulation.
